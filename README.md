# Dynamic DNS for Godaddy
Python script for updating Godaddy DNS zone file for folks with dynamic IP. It uses [this pygodaddy library](https://github.com/observerss/pygodaddy). See docs for installing and using it.

Pretty basic now. I'm newbie in Python. I'm sure this could be a lot better.

TODO:
  - better logging
  - limit size of log file
  - I forgot now but there are more things to do

Just edit script to include your username, password and domain.
